DURATION : 20th JUNE-20th AUG 2024

    The objectives of the Java program designed to track and manage student grades are as follows:

Input Handling:

Prompt the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments until they decide to finish by entering -1.
Data Management:
Store the entered grades in a list (ArrayList<Double>) for easy access and calculation.
Average Calculation:
Compute the average grade from the grades entered by the user.

Grade Evaluation:

Determine the letter grade based on the calculated average grade using predefined grade ranges (A for 90-100, B for 80-89, C for 70-79, D for 60-69, F for below 60).

GPA Calculation:

Calculate the GPA based on the average grade, mapping it to a GPA scale (4.0 for A, 3.0 for B, 2.0 for C, 1.0 for D, 0.0 for F).

Output Presentation:

Display a summary including the total number of grades entered, the calculated average grade, the letter grade, and the GPA.

User Interface:

Provide a clear and interactive command-line interface using Scanner for input and formatted output to present the results.
Validation:

Ensure input validation to reject grades that fall outside the valid range (0-100) and handle input termination (-1 to finish input).

Educational Utility:

Serve as a tool for educational purposes to help students and educators track and evaluate academic performance across multiple subjects or assignments.
By achieving these objectives, the program enables effective management and evaluation of student grades, providing insights into overall performance and supporting educational decision-making processes.
